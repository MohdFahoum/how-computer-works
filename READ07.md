### what is a jave secript

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.


* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

### Naming in JS 

* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
* The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or anunderscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
* you cannot key word or reserved words.

### ARRAYS 

*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.*


### EXPRESSIONS 

*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE.

### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 

NAME OPERATOR PURPOSE & NOTES
ADDITION + Adds one value to another
SUBTRACTION Subtracts one value from another
DIVISION I Divides two values
EXAMPLE RESULT
10 + 5 15
10 - 5 5
10 I 5 2
MULTIPLICATION * Multiplies two values using an asterisk
(Note that this is not the letter x) 10 * 5 50
INCREMENT + + Adds one to the current number
i = 10; . i++; 11 
DECREMENT


### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
