### What Makes a computer , computer?

now computers are every where, even the Smartwatches now , we can call it a computer.
then how does it even work! this is what we will answer in the below details:

*first of all computers are made to help people solve complex data
and help them manipulate equations*

the first step also was to build a device that do the below jobs:

* take an input
* store it
* do the processing 
* display an output

that actually what make a computer , computer.

### Binary and Data 

inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carries all the information of the computer.

now , how do you store a represent information using electisity?
*will if we have a single wire and electisity comes through it , 
this means that we have two options for the status of the wire (on-off)

this can lead us to to say that (on - off) is actully an information even how small it is 
because if we have more than one wire this will bring more (on - off) status and it leads to 
**ZEROS** of **ONES** into language machine 

now lets take a look on how input information becomes an out but through the computer
*when you press a key on your keyboard , that number convertes into a binary digit (1.0)
then the Cpu requests step by step instructions from memory to tell her how to draw the letter , 
the CPU install these instructions and then store them in the memory as pixels 
finally, these pixel information sent binary to the screen witch is your display device , 
the screen is an output device that converts these binary numbers into a tiny little pixel 
and represent them to gather to show the image (for example).

### how software and hardware can act to gather 

the cpu recieves a simple commands that tell it witch ciurcit to use ,
for example , one circuit can be used to calculate a number , while the other
can be used to store this the output into the memory 

*the binary numbers are stored in the memory and fitch \ execute them one by one 
software tells the computer most of the times what todo , but when you are surfing the web , 
and lestining to music , and chatting with a friend on the same time 
the computer runs all of these process to gather 

but how the computer can run all of this information at once 
**to find out we have to take a look into the OPERATING SYSTEM :D** 

the operation system is the master program that manges to tell the computer how to handle all 
of such information to gather
